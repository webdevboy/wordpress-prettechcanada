== Description ==

You have just stumbled across one of the fastest WordPress share button plugins available - when speed is a priority, you needn’t think twice, Simple Share Buttons Light is blazingly fast.

The aim was pretty straight-forward: Create one of, if not the fastest share buttons plugin, whilst keeping the core functionality everyone will expect – pick and choose share buttons and have a couple of choices for how they will appear.

How can we put this… under 5 milliseconds! Yes, seriously – Simple Share Buttons Light loads in under 0.005 seconds consistently.

As you would expect, this level of speed does come at the cost of some features, if you need more then checkout the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/" target="_blank">Adder</a> and <a href="https://simplesharebuttons.com/plus/">Plus</a> versions.
